Excellent. Given the context of the FlexPower challenge, Task 7 is asking you to move beyond just processing the data and think about how a real-world system would securely serve that data to different people. They want to see that you can think about system design, security, and user needs.

Here is a suggested framework you can adapt and build upon for your submission. It is specifically tailored to the roles and data mentioned in the challenge.

### A Suggested Permissions Framework for FlexPower

This framework is built on the principle of **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, which is a standard and highly effective security model. The core idea is to assign permissions to *roles* rather than individual users, which makes the system much easier to manage.

The framework can be broken down into three steps:

#### Step 1: Define the Roles (The "Who")

Based on the challenge description, we can identify several key user roles. Some are internal to FlexPower, and one is external (the customer).

| Role | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Trader** | An internal user who actively buys and sells energy. Needs real-time data to make market decisions. |
| **Sales Manager** | An internal user managing relationships with asset owners. Needs to see performance and financial data for the specific assets they manage. |
| **Operations Analyst** | An internal user responsible for monitoring the overall health and performance of the entire portfolio. |
| **Asset Owner** | An **external user** (the customer). They should only ever see data related to their own specific assets. |
| **Administrator** | A technical user (like a Data Engineer) who needs full access to maintain and debug the system. |

#### Step 2: Identify the Resources (The "What")

These are the data entities and reports that need to be secured. We can group them logically.

* **Raw Data / Tables:**
    * `Assets` (Contractual and technical data)
    * `Forecasts` (Production forecasts)
    * `Live_Measurements` (Real-time production data)
    * `Trades` (Internal trading records)
    * `Market_Prices` (Public market data)
* **Processed Data / Reports:**
    * `Trading_Performance_Report` (Metrics like revenue, VWAP per asset)
    * `Imbalance_Cost_Report` (Imbalance costs per asset)
    * `Portfolio_Performance_Dashboard` (An aggregated view of all assets)
    * `Invoice` (The final bill for an asset owner)

#### Step 3: Create an Access Control Matrix (The "How")

This matrix connects the **Roles** to the **Resources** with specific **Permissions** (e.g., `Read`, `None`). This is the heart of your concept. A key concept to implement here is **Row-Level Security (RLS)**, which filters data so users only see the rows they are authorized to see.

Here is a sample Access Control Matrix you could present:

| Resource | Administrator | Trader | Sales Manager | Operations Analyst | Asset Owner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **-- Data Tables --** | | | | | |
| `Assets` | Read (All) | Read (All) | **Read (Own Assets)** | Read (All) | **Read (Own Assets)** |
| `Forecasts` | Read (All) | Read (All) | **Read (Own Assets)** | Read (All) | **Read (Own Assets)** |
| `Live_Measurements` | Read (All) | Read (All) | Read (None) | Read (All) | **Read (Own Assets)** |
| `Trades` | Read (All) | Read (All) | Read (None) | Read (All) | Read (None) |
| `Market_Prices` | Read (All) | Read (All) | Read (All) | Read (All) | Read (None) |
| **-- Reports --** | | | | | |
| `Trading_Performance`| Read (All) | Read (All) | **Read (Own Assets)** | Read (All) | **Read (Own Assets)** |
| `Imbalance_Cost` | Read (All) | Read (All) | **Read (Own Assets)** | Read (All) | **Read (Own Assets)** |
| `Portfolio_Dashboard` | Read (All) | Read (All) | Read (None) | Read (All) | Read (None) |
| `Invoice` | Read (All) | Read (None) | **Read (Own Assets)** | Read (None) | **Read (Own Assets)** |

**Key takeaway from the matrix:** The `Asset Owner` and `Sales Manager` roles are heavily restricted by **Row-Level Security** (noted as **"Read (Own Assets)"**). This is the most critical security feature for a multi-tenant system like this.

### How to Present This in Your Solution

1.  **In your `README.md`:** Create a dedicated section for "Task 7: Data Permissions Framework".
    * Explain the RBAC concept you've chosen.
    * Define the roles and responsibilities.
    * Present the Access Control Matrix table clearly.
    * Explicitly mention that your design relies on **Row-Level Security** to ensure data segregation for clients and sales managers. This shows you're thinking about critical security aspects.

2.  **(Optional) In your Code:** You can create a simple proof-of-concept. You don't need a full login system. You could, for example:
    * Create a Python dictionary or a JSON file that represents your Access Control Matrix.
    * Write a simple function `can_access(role, resource, asset_id)` that checks permissions.
    * When generating a report (from Task 6), you could add a "header" that says "Generating this report for Role: `Trader`" and then use your function to show which data would be included.

This approach demonstrates that you understand the business requirements, can design a secure and scalable system, and can translate a high-level concept into a practical plan.
